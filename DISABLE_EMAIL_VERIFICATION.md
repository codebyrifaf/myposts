# Remove Email Verification - Setup Guide

## Step 1: Disable Email Confirmation in Supabase Dashboard

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: `tngjmzywpcgcxwxcpdrm`
3. **Navigate to Authentication**:
   - Click **"Authentication"** in the left sidebar
   - Click **"Settings"** tab
4. **Disable Email Confirmation**:
   - Find **"Enable email confirmations"** setting
   - **Turn OFF** this toggle
   - Click **"Save"** to apply changes

## Step 2: Update Auth Settings (Optional)
In the same Authentication Settings page:
- **Disable "Enable secure email change"** if you want instant email changes
- **Set "Site URL"** to `http://localhost:8081` for development

## Step 3: Test the App
After disabling email confirmation:
1. Try signing up with a new account
2. You should be automatically signed in without email verification
3. No "Please check your email" message should appear

## What This Changes:
- ✅ Users can sign up and use the app immediately
- ✅ No email verification required
- ✅ Faster user onboarding
- ❌ Less security (anyone can use any email address)

## Alternative: Keep Email Verification but Auto-Login
If you want to keep some security but improve UX, you can:
1. Keep email confirmation enabled
2. Allow users to use the app while "unconfirmed"
3. Show a reminder to verify email later
